      "Let's break down the log file and address the email submission issue:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Exceptions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* There are **multiple exceptions** related to a `DBCPConnectionPool` Controller Service attempting to connect to a PostgreSQL database.\n",
      "* **Key errors:** \n",
      "    * **\"Driver class postgresql is not found\"**:  This indicates that the PostgreSQL JDBC driver (the library that allows NiFi to communicate with PostgreSQL) isn't available on the NiFi classpath.\n",
      "    * **\"No suitable driver for the given Database Connection URL\"**: This usually means the driver is missing or the connection URL is incorrect.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Email Submission Failure (16:33:55)**\n",
      "\n",
      "It's highly likely that the email submission failure is tied to the database connection errors. Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Dependency Issue:** The \"Driver class postgresql is not found\" error is a strong indicator that the PostgreSQL JDBC driver is missing.  NiFi needs this driver to interact with PostgreSQL. \n",
      "* **Connection URL:** Although you don't provide the database connection URL, the \"No suitable driver\" error suggests the URL might also be configured incorrectly. NiFi might not be able to find the PostgreSQL driver based on the provided URL.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Troubleshooting Steps:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Install the PostgreSQL JDBC Driver:**\n",
      "   * Make sure you have the appropriate PostgreSQL JDBC driver JAR file (e.g., `postgresql-42.5.1.jar`). You can find drivers on the [PostgreSQL website](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/).\n",
      "   * **Add the driver to NiFi's classpath:** \n",
      "      * You can either place the JAR file directly in NiFi's `lib` directory (the easiest approach), or you can modify NiFi's `nifi.properties` file to include the path to the JAR file (more advanced option).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Verify the Connection URL:**\n",
      "   * **Double-check the database connection URL:** It should follow the pattern `jdbc:postgresql://<hostname>:<port>/<database_name>`. \n",
      "   * Make sure the hostname, port, and database name are correct, and that the database is accessible.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Review the DBCPConnectionPool Configuration:**\n",
      "   * **Ensure you have configured the `DBCPConnectionPool` Controller Service correctly.** This includes settings for the JDBC URL, username, password, and any other necessary properties.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Additional Notes:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Log Levels:** To get a more detailed picture of the errors, increase NiFi's logging levels.\n",
      "* **Error Messages:**  Pay close attention to specific error messages NiFi provides when it fails to connect to the database. \n",
      "* **Restart:** After making changes, restart NiFi.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Log Lines:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Look for log lines that mention the `DBCPConnectionPool` Controller Service and the PostgreSQL driver.\n",
      "* Error messages often include stack traces, which can be helpful for identifying the exact cause of the problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me know if you can provide the following, and I can help you refine the troubleshooting process:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Database Connection URL:** The complete URL used in the `DBCPConnectionPool` Controller Service configuration.\n",
      "* **PostgreSQL Driver Version:** The version of the PostgreSQL JDBC driver you have installed.\n",
      "* **NiFi Version:** The version of NiFi you are running. \n",
